# Calculating-Pi
I created my own algorithm for calculating pi.  Here I'm using the Apfloat library to get arbitrary precision.
This is my initial code.
Some explanation is in the java file.
Future Updates:
  Better documentation and explanation of the algorithm
  Gui to choose how many digits you want
  ???
